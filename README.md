# Expedia-Booking-prediction
Expedia.com, a large online travel agency (OTA), has collected a rich dataset on search behaviors. The dataset contains detailed information of all properties that were displayed in each search session (srch_id), whether the customer clicked on a property (click_bool) and whether he/she made a booking (booking_bool). The data and detailed description thereof are in the accompanying Excel file, respectively on tab ‘data’ and ‘data description.’

The project is aimed to solve the following problems:  
Build a model that predicts the likelihood a property will be clicked upon (indicating the customer is interested).  
Build a model that predicts the likelihood a property that has been clicked upon will be booked.  
Propose a scoring model that allows Expedia to rank order the list of properties for each customer based on the expected gross booking revenue.
